DESCRIPTION = """\
Fold a samply profile into a plain-text report.

Reads the JSON samply writes under `--save-only`, whether it recorded the run
itself or imported a `perf.data`, and prints where the CPU went: self time by
crate and by symbol, time on the stack, and the hottest stacks.

Addresses in the profiled binary are resolved with `addr2line`, which recovers
inlined frames rather than charging them to whatever they were inlined into. In
an optimized Rust binary most of the work inlines into a handful of outer
symbols, so a symbol-table reading would report little beyond `main`. A shared
library is read from its dynamic symbol table with `nm` instead: a stripped
system library has no debug info for addr2line, which then answers with the
nearest preceding exported symbol rather than admitting it doesn't know.

Samples from every thread and process that ran the binary are aggregated, so a
recording of several iterations reads as one run, and whatever looped them does
not read at all.

The header reports how many stacks unwound completely. Treat the inclusive
table as a floor rather than a measurement whenever that share is below 95%.
